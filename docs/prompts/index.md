## Quest Ideation Interview

[Quest Ideation Interview Prompt](../../prompts/quest-ideation-interview.md)

A comprehensive interview-style prompt designed to help you discover and define your next Quest. This tool guides you through:

- **Community strategy** - Plan how you'll share and engage throughout your Quest

### How to Use the Interview
1. **Set aside 30-45 minutes** for focused thinking
2. **Work through each question** thoughtfully - don't rush
3. **Write down your responses** to track your thinking process
4. **Iterate and refine** your Quest definition based on your answers
5. **Use insights** to complete your Quest planning worksheet
