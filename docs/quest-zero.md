# Quest Zero: Your LBEiP Onboarding Journey

*Setting Up Your Learn_Build_Earn_in_Public Operating System*

---

## Welcome, Future Quest Leader!

Quest Zero is your first official Quest. Its purpose is simple: **install the LBEiP operating system** and make your public declaration. This isn't just setupâ€”it's your first practice round.

**Time Investment:** 2-3 hours over one week
**Outcome:** You'll have your toolkit ready and your first public post live

---

## Phase 1: Learn (Day 1, 45 minutes)

### Step 1: Read and Absorb
- [ ] Read the complete [LBEiP Framework](framework.md) (30 minutes)
- [ ] Take the [Self-Assessment Quiz](assessment.md) (5 minutes)
- [ ] Bookmark this repository for easy reference (1 minute)

### Step 2: Reflect on Key Questions
Grab a pen and paper. Write your answers to these questions:

1. **What drew you to LBEiP?** What problem are you trying to solve?
2. **What's your current role/domain?** (e.g., "VP of Product at a SaaS startup")
3. **What big strategic questions keep you up at night?**

---

## Phase 2: Build (Days 2-4, 90 minutes total)

### Step 3: Define Your North Star (30 minutes)

Write 2-3 sentences answering each:

**Freedom means...**
- What would intellectual freedom look like for you?
- What would financial/creative freedom enable?
- When will you know you've "made it"?

**A better world means...**
- What problems do you want to help solve?
- How does your expertise serve something bigger than yourself?
- What legacy do you want to leave in your field?

### Step 4: Set Up Your Toolkit (30 minutes)

**Physical Sanctuary Setup:**
- [ ] Buy a dedicated notebook (recommended: Leuchtturm1917 or Moleskine)
- [ ] Get a quality pen (recommended: Lamy Safari or similar)
- [ ] Choose a specific location for your Monday Sanctuary sessions

**Digital Studio Setup:**
- [ ] Create a folder on your computer: "LBEiP_Studio"
- [ ] Install or bookmark a diagramming tool (Miro, Whimsical, or draw.io)
- [ ] Choose your writing app (Google Docs, Notion, or similar)

**Stage Setup:**
- [ ] Update your LinkedIn profile to reflect your role as a strategic thinker
- [ ] Follow 5-10 other professionals whose thinking you admire
- [ ] Draft your first post (don't publish yet)

### Step 5: Choose Your First Real Quest (30 minutes)

Using the [Quest Selection Filter](../templates/quest-planning/quest-selection-worksheet.md):

1. **Brainstorm 5-7 potential Quests** related to challenges in your domain
2. **Score each Quest** on Relevance, Curiosity, Impact, and Scope (1-5 scale)
3. **Choose your highest-scoring Quest** for the next 6-12 weeks

---

## Phase 3: Earn (in public) (Day 5, 30 minutes)

### Step 6: Make Your Declaration

**Template for your first LinkedIn post:**

```
I'm adopting a "Learn, Build, Earn in Public" approach to my work as a [YOUR ROLE].

I believe the best strategies emerge from transparent thinking and collaborative learning. 

Over the next [TIME PERIOD], I'll be sharing my process as I embark on my first Quest:

"[YOUR QUEST TITLE]"

This isn't about having all the answersâ€”it's about asking better questions and sharing the journey of finding them.

I'll be posting weekly updates on my progress, learnings, and the frameworks I'm building along the way.

If you're interested in [YOUR DOMAIN/TOPIC], I'd love your thoughts and perspectives.

Here we go! ðŸš€

#LBEiP #StrategyInPublic #[RelevantHashtags]
```

**Before you post:**
- [ ] Read it aloud to check the tone
- [ ] Remove any confidential information
- [ ] Add relevant hashtags for your industry
- [ ] Tag 2-3 people you'd like to engage with

### Step 7: Hit Publish
- [ ] **Post your declaration**
- [ ] **Screenshot it** and save it in your LBEiP_Studio folder
- [ ] **Set a calendar reminder** for your weekly Monday Sanctuary session

---

## Phase 4: Filter (End of Week 1, 15 minutes)

### Step 8: Review Your First Week
- [ ] **Count your engagement:** likes, comments, shares, DMs
- [ ] **Note the quality:** Which comments were most insightful?
- [ ] **Identify connections:** Who are the interesting people who engaged?
- [ ] **Capture insights:** What surprised you about the response?
