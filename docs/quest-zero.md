# Quest Zero: Your LBEiP Onboarding Journey

*Setting Up Your Learn_Build_Earn_in_Public Operating System*

---

## Welcome, Future Quest Leader!

Quest Zero is your first official Quest. Its purpose is simple: **set up your creative workshop** and open your window to the world. This isn't just setupâ€”it's your first practice round in sharing your creative journey.

**Time Investment:** 2-3 hours over one week
**Outcome:** You'll have your creative spaces ready and your first public post live

---

## Phase 1: Learn (Day 1, 45 minutes)

### Step 1: Read and Absorb
- [ ] Read the complete [LBEiP Framework](framework.md) (30 minutes)
- [ ] Take the [Self-Assessment Quiz](assessment.md) (5 minutes)
- [ ] Bookmark this repository for easy reference (1 minute)

### Step 2: Reflect on Key Questions
Grab a pen and paper. Write your answers to these questions:

1. **What drew you to LBEiP?** What creative challenge are you trying to solve?
2. **What's your creative craft/domain?** (e.g., "Writer focusing on sci-fi", "Frontend developer", "Digital artist")
3. **What creative questions or projects excite you most right now?**

---

## Phase 2: Build (Days 2-4, 90 minutes total)

### Step 3: Define Your Creative Purpose (North Star) (30 minutes)

Write 2-3 sentences answering each:

**Creative freedom means...**
- What would creative autonomy look like for you?
- What would financial freedom from your creative work enable?
- When will you know you've achieved creative success?

**A better world means...**
- How does your creative work contribute positively to the world?
- What problems do you want to help solve through your craft?
- What legacy do you want to leave through your creative work?

### Step 4: Set Up Your Three Spaces (30 minutes)

**Sanctuary Setup (Inspiration & Thought):**
- [ ] Choose your inspiration capture tool (notebook, sketchbook, voice memos app)
- [ ] Designate a specific location for your Sanctuary sessions
- [ ] Identify your preferred time for unstructured creative thinking

**Studio Setup (The Craft):**
- [ ] Set up your primary creative tools (code editor, art software, writing app, etc.)
- [ ] Create a folder/workspace: "LBEiP_Creative_Work"
- [ ] Organize your reference materials and inspiration sources

**Stage Setup (The Window & Connection):**
- [ ] Choose your primary sharing platform (GitHub, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, blog, etc.)
- [ ] Update your profile to reflect your creative focus
- [ ] Follow 5-10 creators whose work inspires you
- [ ] Draft your first post (don't publish yet)

### Step 5: Choose Your First Creative Quest (30 minutes)

Using the [Quest Selection Filter](../templates/quest-planning/quest-selection-worksheet.md):

1. **Brainstorm 5-7 potential Quests** related to your creative interests and goals
2. **Score each Quest** on Relevance, Curiosity, Impact, and Scope (1-5 scale)
3. **Choose your highest-scoring Quest** for the next 6-12 weeks

**Quest Examples by Craft:**
- **Writer:** "Write and publish a three-part blog series on [topic you're passionate about]"
- **Developer:** "Build and open-source a tool that solves [problem you've encountered]"
- **Artist:** "Create a series of [X] pieces exploring [theme/technique you want to develop]"
- **Musician:** "Compose and release an EP documenting [musical journey/experiment]"

---

## Phase 3: Earn (in public) (Day 5, 30 minutes)

### Step 6: Make Your Declaration

**Template for your first public post:**

```
I'm adopting a more open approach to my creative process as a [YOUR CREATIVE ROLE].

I believe the best creative work emerges from sharing the journey, not just the destination.

Over the next [TIME PERIOD], I'll be sharing my process as I embark on my first Quest:

"[YOUR QUEST TITLE]"

This isn't about having all the answersâ€”it's about exploring, creating, and learning in public.

I'll be sharing regular updates on my progress, discoveries, and the work I'm creating along the way.

If you're working on similar creative challenges, I'd love to connect and learn from your journey too.

Here we go! ðŸš€

```

**Platform-Specific Adaptations:**
- **GitHub:** Focus on the technical learning and building aspects
- **Instagram/TikTok:** Emphasize visual process and behind-the-scenes content
- **Blog/Newsletter:** Longer-form reflection on the creative journey
- **LinkedIn:** Professional creative development angle

**Before you post:**
- [ ] Read it aloud to check the tone feels authentic to you
- [ ] Ensure you're comfortable sharing this level of openness
- [ ] Add relevant hashtags for your creative community
- [ ] Consider tagging 2-3 creators whose work you admire (optional)

### Step 7: Hit Publish
- [ ] **Post your declaration**
- [ ] **Screenshot it** and save it in your LBEiP_Studio folder
- [ ] **Set a calendar reminder** for your weekly Monday Sanctuary session

---

## Phase 4: Filter (End of Week 1, 15 minutes)

### Step 8: Review Your First Week
- [ ] **Count your engagement:** likes, comments, shares, DMs, follows
- [ ] **Note the quality:** Which comments were most insightful or encouraging?
- [ ] **Identify connections:** Who are the interesting creators who engaged?
- [ ] **Capture insights:** What surprised you about sharing your creative process?
- [ ] **Reflect on feelings:** How did it feel to share your work openly?
