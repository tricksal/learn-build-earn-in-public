## ðŸ¤” Common Quick Start Questions

**Q: What if I don't know what Quest to choose?**
A: Pick the strategic question that's been nagging you lately. If you're still stuck, try: "What's the biggest challenge in my role right now?"

**Q: What if nobody engages with my posts?**
A: Start with asking questions rather than making statements. People love to share their expertise.

**Q: How much time does this actually take?**
A: 2-3 hours per week if you follow the rhythm. Less if you simplify.

**Q: What if I can't share confidential information?**
A: Share your thinking process, not your data. Read about the [Principle of Abstraction](framework.md#5.1).

## ðŸŽ¯ Remember the Goal

You're not trying to become a LinkedIn influencer. You're trying to:
- Think more clearly about strategic questions
- Build authentic professional relationships  
- Learn faster through public feedback
- Create value for others through your insights

**Start messy. Start small. Just start.**
