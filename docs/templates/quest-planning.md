## Quest Planning Best Practices

### Start Small
Your first Quest should be achievable within 2-4 weeks. Build confidence and momentum before tackling larger projects.

### Be Specific
"Write a blog post" is vague. "Write a 1,500-word blog post analyzing three productivity frameworks for remote workers" is a Quest.

### Include Learning Goals
Every Quest should expand your skills or knowledge. What will you learn that you didn't know before?

### Plan Your Sharing
Decide upfront how you'll document and share your process. This isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's integral to the Quest.

### Set Success Metrics
Define what "done" looks like, both for the creative output and the learning/community outcomes.
