## How to Use Reflection Templates

Avoid generic responses. The more specific and honest you are, the more valuable your reflections become.

### Track Patterns Over Time

### Share Selectively
Some reflections are private, but consider sharing key insights with your community as part of your Quest narrative.

## Reflection Best Practices

### Create a Consistent Environment
Find a quiet space where you can think clearly. Some prefer journaling by hand, others prefer digital tools.

### Use Prompting Questions
Don't just summarize what happened. Ask deeper questions:
- Why did this work/not work?
- What does this tell me about my process?
- How can I apply this learning going forward?
- What patterns am I noticing?

### Balance Critique with Celebration
Acknowledge challenges and areas for improvement, but also celebrate progress and wins, no matter how small.

### Connect to Larger Goals
Link weekly reflections to your broader creative and professional objectives. How does this week's work serve your long-term vision?
