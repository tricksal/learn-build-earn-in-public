# LBEiP System Prompts

This directory contains specialized system prompts designed to support various aspects of the LBEiP (Learning by Engaging in Projects) framework using Large Language Models.

## Purpose

- Provide clear role definitions and behavioral guidelines
- Include specific techniques and methodologies
- Offer sample questions and interaction patterns
- Define success metrics and output formats
- Support content creation alongside the core process
